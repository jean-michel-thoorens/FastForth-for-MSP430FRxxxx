; small upload macro for uploading forth source via tera term tested with version 4.88
; Tera Term website http://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en
; tera term supports call stack up to 10 levels on my laptop so using iterative approach here

; upload source file to target line by line and waits for "ok." after transmission of line.
; supports nesting include with pathname
; line containing include directive is not sent to target
; max source line length is 511
; include path\filename.ext

; example project.txt :
; include dump.txt
; include ..\common\disassembler-m3.txt
; include demo2.fth

; TODO:
; "require" - support for single inclusion
; error handling for MAXLEVEL
; path handling relative to root file
; test path handling

; global definitions
